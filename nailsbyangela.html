            <h4>Dry Manicure</h4>
            <p>One of the main benefits of a dry manicure is the hold that it has on your nail polish.Your nail plate naturally curves in a ‘C’ shape. However, once submerged under water, the ‘C’ curl becomes lesser. Annoyingly, the natural nail plate is often not completely dry by the time that the polish has started being applied. So, once the nail plate is fully dry, the polish doesn’t lay completely flat on the surface and can begin to peel away from the nail. </p>
